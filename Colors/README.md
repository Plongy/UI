# Colors
The color palette in this directory serves as a reference. The proposal is to:
* let Cerise Strong, Cerise New and Cerise Light (possibly under different names) become the new official primary colors
* off-black, yellow and off-white to be official secondary colors
* Cerise Ultra (#e91e63) where suitable

Current "cerise" as well as the cerise from THS' bylaws is provided in the image for reference.
